                    The DC Universe (DCU) is the shared universe in which most stories in American comic
                    book titles published by DC Comics take place. In context, the term "DC Universe" usually refers to the
                    main DC continuity. It contains such well-known superheroes as Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, the
                    Flash, Green Lantern, Aquaman, Green Arrow, Captain Marvel, Martian Manhunter, and Cyborg; as well as
                    teams such as the Justice League, the Justice Society of America, the Suicide Squad, Doom Patrol, and
                    the Teen Titans. It also contains well-known supervillains, including the Joker, Lex Luthor, the
                    Cheetah, the Reverse-Flash, Sinestro, Black Manta, Deathstroke, Black Adam, Brainiac, and Darkseid.

                    The term "DC Multiverse" refers to the collection of all continuities within DC Comics publications.
                    Within the Multiverse, the main DC Universe has gone by many names, but in recent years has been
                    referred to by "Prime Earth" (not to be confused with "Earth Prime") or "Earth 0".

                    The main DC Universe, as well as the alternate realities related to it, were quickly adapted to other
                    media such as film serials or radio dramas. In subsequent decades, the continuity between all of these
                    media became increasingly complex with certain storylines and events designed to simplify or streamline
                    the more confusing aspects of characters' histories.
